This is a case study designed for top tier strategic consulting company to solve business problem.
\
Case Scenario: \
Company A is a major utility company providing gas and electricity to corporate, SME and residential customers. In recent years, post-liberalization of the energy market in Europe, company A has had a growing problem with increasing customer defections above industry average. The churn issue is most acute in the SME division and thus they want it to be the first priority. \
Thus, I explored the data given and built models that can predict the probability of churn. \
In this repository, you can find the datasets given and codes.

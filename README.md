# ESCP ML with Python Final Project
This is a case study designed for top tier strategic consulting company to solve business problem.\\

**Case Scenario:** \
Company A is a major utility company providing gas and electricity to corporate, SME and residential customers. In recent years, post-liberalization of the energy market in Europe, company A has had a growing problem with increasing customer defections above industry average. The churn issue is most acute in the SME division and thus they want it to be the first priority. \
There are 3 datasets given as follows; 1. Features of customers 2. Electric prices for each customer 3. Churn data. \
I merged those 3 and explored the them to find out which model to choose then built models that can predict the probability of churn. \
In this repository, you can find the datasets and codes of modelling. \\
